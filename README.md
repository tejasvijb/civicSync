CivicSync ‚Äì Citizen-Issue Reporting & Voting Platform

CivicSync ‚Äì Citizen-Issue Reporting & Voting Platform
Scenario
Across cities, towns, and local neighborhoods, people face daily issues like potholes, broken streetlights, uncollected garbage, and unsafe areas. These problems are rarely logged, tracked, or resolved transparently.

CivicSync is a web-based platform designed to simulate a modern civic reporting system. It empowers authenticated citizens to report civic issues, browse public issues submitted by others, vote on what's important, and visualize resolution trends over time.

Your task is to build a secure, scalable MVP that enables smooth issue lifecycle management and community participation.

üéØ Objective
Design and implement a fullstack application with proper authentication and authorization, enabling users to:

Report location-specific civic issues with supporting context
View a real-time, paginated feed of all public issues
Vote once on any issue to surface priority for resolution
Track their personal reports and editing privileges
Visualize status/category-wise issue breakdowns and voting trends
Interact with both list-based and map-based representations of issues
üë• User Role: user
There is a single role in this application: a citizen user. However, the actions available to a user are based on ownership and issue status.

üîê Authentication & Authorization
Users must be able to register and log in securely using email and password
Auth tokens or sessions should persist across refresh
Access to all core routes and actions must be gated by auth
Users can:
Only edit/delete their own issues
Only edit/delete issues that are still in Pending state
Vote only once per issue
